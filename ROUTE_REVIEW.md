# Route Review: Building 1

Generated from `src/navigation/data/building1.ts` by `tools/route-review/generate.cjs`.
Overlay: `reference/proposals/building1-network.jpg` (IDs match this list).

At school, confirm or correct each item, then set its `status` to `'checked'` in the data
file (move a door or point by editing its coordinates). Student directions use only
checked items; a route appears only when every door, walkway and stair on it is checked.

## Open areas: routed now

These use the walkable-space data in `src/navigation/data/building1Walkable.ts`
(source: User, 2026-10-22: the student area, Quad, Lunch Shelter and the open space between them are generally walkable. Edges from the campus PDF walls.). Routes stay inside it, keep clear of walls,
and go around stairs.

| Destination | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lunch Shelter | checked | Wide open covered area with no doors; open on its south and west sides |
| Senior Hill | checked | Round student area at the middle-right edge of the Quad; boundary is a draft |
| Quad | checked | Open Quad |
| Student Area | checked | Open area west of the Quad |

Stairs treated as obstacles (not flat walking space): `stair-cafeteria`, `stair-career`, `stair-quad-south`.

Please confirm at school:
* the open space has no fences, planters, steps or locked gates that block the drawn routes;
* the Lunch Shelter is open on its south and west sides (and whether the north side is open);
* where Senior Hill's edge is (the current circle is a draft).

## Ramp (proposal, not used in routes)

Connects the ground-level gap to Building 1 Floor 2; landing position and access to be confirmed. Review image: `reference/review/ramp.jpg`.
Confirm the Floor 2 landing, that it is step-free, and that students may use it.

## Room entrances: routed now (17)

The side of each room's entrance is confirmed; **where along that wall the door is, is not
measured** (every door point is `approximate`). Routes go to the approach point just outside
the door (in walkable space), then to the door. Overlay: `reference/review/entrances.jpg`.
At school, note for each room whether the real door is left of, right of or at the drawn point,
and roughly how far (in steps); then move `door` in `building1Walkable.ts` and set
`positionStatus: 'checked'`.

| Career Center | checked | the Quad | approximate (519.7, 157.8) | Bottom side, below the name (confirmed); exact point approximate |

Still not routed (no confirmed entrance): Cafeteria, Kitchen, Wellness Center, Admin Offices,
the "1-159" room (label partly illegible), restrooms (T) and the other unlabeled rooms.

## Door graph for enclosed rooms (22, review mode only)

Proposed doors sit at the centre of the wall facing the walkway. Confirm **which wall the
door is on and roughly where**, and whether students may use it.

floors it reaches, and where its landing is on each floor.

## Not in the network yet

* **Elevator** (`elevator-1`, room labeled ELEV. M.): is it an elevator, where is its entrance,
  and which floors does it serve?
* **Wellness Center, Kitchen, Cafeteria, Admin Offices:** where are their doors?
* **Ramp** (see `reference/proposals/ramp-proposal.jpg`): approach, turn, end point, which
  level it reaches, and whether it is step-free and open to students.
* **Building 1 Floor 2 and Floor 3 hallways and doors:** not recorded yet, so upstairs rooms
  have no routes.
* **Building entrances** from Third Street and Harvard Road.
