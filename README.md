# Bell Space

Student app for Burbank High School (Expo SDK 58 / React Native 0.88). See
`PROJECT.md` for scope, `TODO.md` for current work and `AGENTS.md` for rules.

## Run on an iPhone (Expo Go)

1. Install **Expo Go** from the App Store.
2. From this folder: `npm install` (first time only), then
   `npx expo start --clear`.
   Use `--clear` after any change to `svg-transformer.cjs` or the map adapters.
3. Scan the QR code with the iPhone Camera app. The phone and computer must
   be on the same Wi-Fi. If the network blocks that, use `npx expo start --tunnel`.

## Checks

```bash
npm test
npx expo lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Chat and Updates need a Supabase project: see `PILOT_SETUP.md`.
